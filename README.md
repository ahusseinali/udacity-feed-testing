# Project Overview

In this project I was given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. My goal was to write unit tests for the feed reading and loading functionality using [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/).

## Install and Run
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open _index.html_ on Google Chrome.

## Tests Validation
1. When the page loads, you will find the tests at the bottom of the page.
2. Validate that all tests pass (no error flags appear).
